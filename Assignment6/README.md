My website idea is custom fishing flies that I tie. Customers can submit an order for premade flies or they can order something to be tied. I will be fairly professional on this website.

I didnt use balance so much as I tried to incorporate so many elements. I would on balance with the monochrome coloring, as I think it is much more usable.

I think if I were to keep working on it I would add more photos, I take lots of photos but I havent yet for my flies.

I didnt face many challenges as the website is very good.
