<h1>Website Ideas</h1>

<h3>Website 1: Custom Fly Sales</h3>
<p>This website would be for me to 
sell the custom made flies I make.
I really enjoy tying flies and I have become fairly good at it.
I would be going for something professional with high end photos.

 <h3>Website 2: Guided Fly Fishing</h3>
 <p>This website would be for my fly fishing guide business.
    This would also be very professional with photos of fish 
    caught on trips. I would use this to hopefully get more trips.

 <h3>Website 3: Photography Website</h3>
 <p>This website would be showcasing the photos I take, and 
    hopefully selling prints. It would be professional and sleek.
    It would also have spots for custom ordering items that arent
    offered.
