<h1>Why I chose these Website Ideas</h1>

<h3>Fly Tying Website</h3>
<p>I chose this idea because I have been learning how
    to tie flies over the last couple years. I feel as if I am
    getting to the point where they could be sold.

<h3>Guided Fly Fishing</h3>
<p>I am working on getting my guide license. This website would
    help me get the business off the ground and bring in more
    clients. It would also be a very professional starting point 
    for clients to look at.

<h3>Photography</h3>
<p>I have been taking photos for years and have seldom printed
    images. I have been told by many that they wanted one of my photos.
    I have never sold any but may look to in the future.
