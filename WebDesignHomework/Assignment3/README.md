* Also unclear in what the root read.me file is?

+ I am confused how you make a list because I did 1,2,3 but it didnt turn into bullet points.

  I had lots of issues at the start because I didnt totally understand alot of the functions with github. I believe that I am starting to get the hang of the formatting. I had alot of issues that made me resort to the github docs. The github docs are amazing, it helped having all of the tutorials for all the different formats in one place. I used this to help with photos, links and headers.

  Attached is a link to the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
