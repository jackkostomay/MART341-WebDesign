i finally took some time and also got some help and finally figured out how to do some of the things i have wanted to do.
FIrst i started by finally centering my text
then I added background color
next i made the banner across the top with the buttons and drop downs
Then i created pages similar to ones i had done in the past
then i made the page compatible across devices
