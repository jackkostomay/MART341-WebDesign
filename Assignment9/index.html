 <h2>Custom Flies</h2>
 <p>I can tie most anything yet price may <b>INCREASE</b> if I don't own the necessary material.<br> As Tom Rosenbauer always said,</p>

    <blockquote>
        I don't think anyone can be truly on top of their game <br>until they understand 
        how a fly is constructed <br> and what it's supposed to do.
     </blockquote>

     Flies I tie include, Dry Flies<sub>1</sub>, Nymphs<sub>2</sub>, and <dfn title="a variation on fly which is fished as a wetfly simulating an aquatic organism">Streamers<sub>3</sub>.</dfn></p>
<p>The spacing doesn't necessarily make sense to me.</p>
<H2>Back Story</H2>
<p>I learned the majority of what I know from <cite>Tom Rosenbauer</cite>. Mr. Rosenbauer is the Fly Fishing Outreach and Education at ORVIS COMPANY.</p>
<p>The first fly I learned is the <del>Pheasant Head</del> <ins>Pheasant Tail</ins> nymph.</p>
<p><s>My fly fishing history is short</s>.</p>
<p>My fly fishing history is long.</p>
<p>Something interesting that I tie is called a <abbr title="Slidable Dry Dropper System">SDDS</abbr>.</p</p>
<p>I learned this system from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMUZUZppAYA">FAS ADD System</a>.</p>
<p>learning this coding system is difficult but interesting.</p>
